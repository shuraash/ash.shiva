### This is a source of a page kinda combination of a professional resume and a demo of some of the skills.

Suddenly my life is changed, and I need to leave for while Europhe without any computer, and can't finish this project as I'm planning.

But it works.

Was a goal this code works from /src in a browser without any building tools.

And, at other side, I'm wanna show skills with building tools.

And try to write 'vanilla js' code keeping in the mind possibiliy to easy transform this code for any popular framework in a few hours.

When I have access to my deveopment Mac again, i will describe everything as I planned.
