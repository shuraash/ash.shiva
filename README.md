### This is a source of a page kinda combination of a professional resume and a demo of some of the skills.

Suddenly my life is changed, and I need to leave the Europhe for 3- months, without any computer, and can't finish this project as I'm planning.

But it works.

Was a goal : this code works from /src in the browser without any building tools (but was needded add one very simple,  to split html/js/scc, it's h_includer.mjs).

And, at other side, I'm wanna show skills with building tools.

And try to write 'vanilla js' code keeping in the mind possibiliy to easy transform this code for any popular framework in a few hours.

When I have access to my deveopment Mac again, i will describe everything as I planned.
