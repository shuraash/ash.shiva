		<p>	My main skill is to “find the solution”. </p>

		<p>
			With my experience, i can solve mostly any task for backend, frontend, database, or all together.
			Starting my career from PL/M, BASIC and Pascal, switching then to Delphi, and after to Web stack,
			I can easily learn new languages or technologies.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have strong experience in JavaScript, PHP, SQL, CSS and many more. Good in data modeling and data analysis.
		</p>
		<p>
			<bbb>CONCERNING FRONTEND DEVELPMENT </bbb> - JS/CSS/Node/JS building tools/etc - check this page source at
			<a href="https://github.com/shuraash/ash.shiva" target="_blank">
				GitHub <img src="media/GitHub-logo-i.png" alt="GitHub">.
			</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			<bbb>ABOUT DATA ANALYSIS</bbb> -  a good example is
			<a href="https://appraisal.secretimmo.lu/" target="_blank">“Secretimmo appraisal tool”</a>.<br/>
			Big data from different sources, a lots of parameters to analyse. Built from scratch.
		</p>

		<p>
			<bbb>BACKEND EXAMPLE</bbb> - 	API for “Secrtimmo App” - download for
			<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/secretimmo/id1638904947" target="_blank"> IOS </a> or
			<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/secretimmo/id1638904947" target="_blank"> Android </a>.
			<br/>
		    Implemented on Node.js with a help of postman.com
			<a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/21572449/UzQvsjmR" target="_blank">(API doc)</a>.<br/>
		</p>

		<p>
			Unfortunately,  <a href="https://www.immotop.lu" target="_blank">IMMOTOP.LU</a> site, I'm work on last 12 years, has a good succsess, and was sold to corportion, and from April 2022 'web-face/fronted' is from this corporate. So no my work in it (just some database tasks).
			Before (and I'm not alone) it was better.
			But it only search & visualisation of AD's, backend still 60%-80% is my code (and clents area for management of their listings).
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, for this company, i made some big tools:  <bba>FactX</bba> (Facturation eXtended) and <bba>WMQ</bba> (Workers/Messages/Queues).
		</p>

		<p>
			<bba>FactX</bba> is a complette company's work flow system: contracts, invoices, clients, shedules, products, a lots of reports, automated tasks, planing, businnes results for sales personal, etc.
			Based on 'deferred projection' idea.
			I can't show detailed screenshots (anyway will be need a lots of them to describe all features, what is not fit to this page), so just one picture (i found it in a trash), for have an imagination:
			<br>
				<img class="wmq-sch" src="media/fx1.jpeg">
			<br>
			In the <bba>FactX</bba> also was used Redis based worker on the server (PHP),
			'shared worker' for a browser, for centralize some tasks between open tabs, (JS of course).
			But most in this project was DB/SQL related work. In conjunction with the main site database, the golbal records count was (and is) tens of millions.
		</p>

		<p>
			<bba>WMQ</bba> is a solution for exchanging listings data between providers, from hundreds sources in a diferrent formats.
			Without punishing MySQL, and with detailed logs. Based on Redis for interprocess communication.

			<img class="wmq-sch" src="media/wmq4.jpeg">
			<br>
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, before, in <bba>WMQ</bba>, was a system of 'alerts' : users can save their searches, and, if any new listing corresponds to the params of saved  search, user will have email or/and push notification about it.
			Around 50k listings and 200k 'alerts' at an time slice, and my solution can notify user max 5 min after new correspond listing inserted in database (which happens every few minutes).
		</p>

		<p>
			Both tools was iplemented on standart Web-Stack: MySQl/PHP/JS + REDIS. Without any 'popular' and abnormal huge framework, so result code works very fast and stable.
		</p>

		<p>
			Plus, first versions of devices app's (IOS & Android) for IMMOTOP also was coded by me using <a href="https://trigger.io" target="_blank">TRIGGER.IO</a> (why now this site not works - no idea).
		</p>


		<br>
		<br>
		<p>
			For Secretimmo I made also tool for 'virtual visits' (view and editing) + video chat (group) + "remote control"
			(agent take control of moving through panorama views).<br>
			With possibility to record a "visit" with voice guide + background music, and play after of course.
			It done using <a href="https://pchen66.github.io/Panolens/" target="_blank">Panolens.js</a> for panoramas
			and WEB-RTC + <a href="https://github.com/feross/simple-peer" target="_blank">simple-peer"</a>
			Tiny Signaling server on WebSockets / Node.js.

			Other interested project i made in begining of 2000-th, was a "Trip". Solution for small logisticts campanies, which have few trucks.
			Was helping to calculate truck trip expenses/incomes/fuel/driver's salary/etc. Mostly database works, but also with
			data import from special controllers installed on the trucks with gps/gsm modules aka "sattelite controlled truck".
			Delphi + Yaffil (Firebird/Interbase)
		</p>

		<p>
			From 90th till middle 2000th - made number of apps for small companies - invoicing/stocking/payments/etc.
			Begining on  MS-DOS / "Paradox" (was better than MS Access and others by my opinion), and after switch to Windows / Delphi.
			Also some random tiny stuff: MIDI clock emulator, Voltmeter (device) testing/calibrating utility. Optron matrix verificaion (also in the device),
			Oil products weight calcultor (for rail road tankers) - it from liquid level (in meters) in the tanker, and then using DB of tanker types + special density tables and air temperature
			calculate the weight of product in the tanker.
			And... did't remeber all of them :)
		</p>

		<p>
			At the very start of my professional career, in ex-USSSR,
			I’m writing software for automation and control of a equipment in huge military radio centres.
			By some shedule, this app send commands (using kind of serial ports) to special controller for switch a parameters on radio transmitters/recivers.
			First, test version, was on Basic (with line numbers), then Turbo Basic, and then Turbo Pascal.
		</p>

		<br>
		<br>
		<p>
			Also I'm spent a very big amount of time on sound / music software. Starts from mod-traker on Commodore Amigo.
			Have a strong background in audio editing / mixing.
			And some, not bad, skills in graphic/video editing - Photoshop, OBS, After Effects, etc.
